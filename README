== Description ==

If you need to maintain a bibliography in bibtex format and also write a Web page to publish the list of your publications, then bib2html is the right solution for you. 

bib2html enables to add bibtex entries formatted as HTML in Wordpress pages and posts. The input data is the bibtex file (either local or remote) and the output is HTML. The entries are formatted by default using the IEEE style. Bibtex source file and a link to the publication are also available from the HTML. 

Features:

* automatic HTML generation
* easy inclusion in wordpress pages/posts by means of a dedicated tag
* possibility of filtering the bibtex entries based on their type (allow, deny)
* possibility to access the single bibtex entry source code to enable copy&paste (toggle-enabled visualization)

* possibility of editing the bibtex file directly from the wordpress administration page

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I edit my bibtex files? =

If your file is local to the blog installation, you have two options:
- via FTP client with text editor
- via Wordpress Admin interface: Manage->Files->Other Files
-- use wp-content/plugins/bib2html/data/mybibfile.bib as a path

Alternatively, you can maintain your updated biblilography by using systems such as citeulike.org and bibsonomy.org; 
specify the bib file using as a URL (e.g., in citeulike, you should use http://www.citeulike.org/bibtex/user/username)

= How are the entries sorted? =

Since version 0.9, the entries are sorted by year starting from the most
recent; in future revision, I plan to make this configurable by the user

= How can I personlize the HTML rendering? =
The HTML rendering is isolated in a template file called bibentry-html.tpl.
Just change it.

== A brief Markdown Example ==

When writing a page/post, you can use the tag [bibtex] as follows:

This is my whole list of publications: [bibtex file=mypub.bib]
If you want to filter the type of bibtex items, you can use one of the attributes allow, deny and key as follows:

This is my list of journal articles:
[bibtex file=mypub.bib allow=article]

This is my list of conference articles and technical reports:
[bibtex file=mypub.bib allow=inproceedings,techreport]

This is the rest of my publications:
[bibtex file=mypub.bib deny=article,inproceedings,techreport]

This is my latest conference paper:
[bibtex file=mypub.bib key=CGW2006]

This is my bibliography maintained at citeulike.org
